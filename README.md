This repository contains code for generating the figures in the manuscript
[**Earthmover-Based Manifold Learning for Analyzing Molecular Conformation Spaces**](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~jkileel/emd_manifolds_Oct16.pdf) by Nathan Zelesko, Amit Moscovich, Joe Kileel, and Amit Singer.

If you have the prerequsities, you can simply run './produce_all_figures.py' to generate the figures in the paper. This will take a few hours.

Prerequisites:
- Python 3 with SciPy and scikit-learn. I recommend the [Anaconda python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
- The PyWavelets package (included in Anaconda)
- The mrcfile Python module, to install it run `pip install mrcfile`.
